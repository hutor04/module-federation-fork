## Thoughts

	1. Local development? 
		a. Running a MF separatly doesn't count store or styling in the shell-app
		b. Running all aps is not easy
		c. Running i home app won't make hot reload
		d. If something fails, difficult to understand what
	2. Think about styles
		a. Common styles, where should it be placed?
			i. In home-app, but then remote apps doesn't have styling
			ii. Shared common library?
		b. Styles interfering -> use css modules
		c. Pass classname to MF, s√• home app can style externally
	3. Why should I have StoreProvide around home-app?
        a. Ok around home. But why around each MF? - so it works separately
